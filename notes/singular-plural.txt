If only used as plural: only list as plural
If used as both and defined as both: only list and define as singular
If used as singular but defined only as plural: only list and define as plural

plural_only: Only exists in the file as plural
defined_in_plural: May be listed as singular but only defined as plural
  if not defined at all, this will be false

Remember that it is necessary to be able to exclude acronyms that only exist as plurals after the fact.


bracketed and bracketed_on_first_use may have been screwed up by the mashing of plurals -- can't remember why these were needed in the first place, seems like bullshit
