# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

#Looks like your app's ./bin/rails is a stub that was generated by Bundler.
#
#In Rails 4, your app's bin/ directory contains executables that are versioned
#like any other source code, rather than stubs that are generated on demand.
#
#Here's how to upgrade:
#
#  bundle config --delete bin    # Turn off Bundler's stub generator
#  rake rails:update:bin         # Use the new Rails 4 executables
#  git add bin                   # Add bin/ to source control
#
#You may need to remove bin/ from your .gitignore as well.
#
#When you install a gem whose executable you want to use in your app,
#generate it and add it to source control:
#
#  bundle binstubs some-gem-name
#  git add bin/new-executable

#/bin
