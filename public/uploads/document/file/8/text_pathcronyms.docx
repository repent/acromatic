This is a list of pathological acronyms.  It contains things like AusAID, which have lower case letters within.  It also has CamelCaseText, both capitalised andUncapitalisedLikeThis.  It has numbers in dumb places, like BICF2 and TEXT2WIN.  Some acronyms are pluralised, like TORs, or even, to be pathological, ToRs.  If it doesn't fuck you up, we'll just have to keep trying harder.
