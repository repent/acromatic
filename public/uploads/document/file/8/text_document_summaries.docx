Gender Dimensions represents the clearest articulation of best practice to guide the practitioner through the whole cycle of a gender-sensitive business environment reform project.  It is structured around the principal phases of (a) diagnostics (which should ideally be done before project activities have been determined so as to inform this decision), (b) solution design, (c) implementation and (d) monitoring and evaluation.  The guide first tackles the fundamentals that are applicable to all projects, before presenting sections on eight sectors of business environment reform (e.g. public - private dialogue and business taxation).  A wealth of practical detail is included, including guidance on where to turn for statistical information, and sample questions for primary research.  Less space is devoted to empirical evidence, although short case studies are scattered throughout.
